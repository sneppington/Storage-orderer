Hello user.

This is a python script that stores all members of a directory on an oredered manner on the parent directory of the script.

How to use:
  Upon opening the script you will be asked which mode do you want to use "['downloads' 'other']".
  The "downloads" mode will move all files in your downloads folder into a folder called "Archive",
  which will be created upon first use, all files will be moved into folders depending on their extension.

  The mode "other" will allow you to input any directory that youd like to have cleaned,
  same procedure as for the "downloads" folder.
